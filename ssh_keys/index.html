<div id="title">Using SSH keys (*NIX)</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    This guide assumes that you're already able to connect to Anapnea via SSH using a password.  If not, please read the <a href="../unix_ssh/index.html">connection guide</a> for Linux or Mac OS X.
    <br />
    <br />
    SSH public key authentication allows you to use one identity to connect to multiple servers.  It also provides enhanced security by ensuring that you password is never transmitted.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Open a Terminal and type <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa</code>.  This will generate a public/private key pair used for authentication.
    <div><img src="images/1.png" alt="You can leave the filename as the default." /></div>
    You can leave the key file name to its default.
    <br />
    <br />
    <em>Use a passphrase!  Anyone that has access to your private key will be able to log in as you!</em>
    <br />
    <br />
    <em><strong>Note:</strong> Keep your private key secure!  Don't give it out to others or leave it in a insecure location.</em>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    Copy the SSH public key to the proper location on the remote server.  Replace <em>username</em> with your Anapnea username.
    <br />
    <br />
    <code>scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub <em>username</em>@anapnea.net:.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
    <br />
    <br />
    <em><strong>Note:</strong> This will overwrite any existing authorized keys for your remote account.</em>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
  	Try connecting to Anapnea via SSH.  You should not have to enter your password to log in, unless you have used a passphrase with your key, which is not sent to the server.
