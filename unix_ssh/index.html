    Virtually every *nix based operating system comes with a terminal emulator and the openssh client pre installed.
    These two are all you need to connect to anapnea, so it's super easy. Start by opening a terminal. These screenshots
    are from Ubuntu but should illustrate what you have to do on any OS.
    (<a href='../putty_connecting'>If you're on windows, here's a link to a PuTTY guide</a>.)

    If you've got an Anapnea account then you're either already familiar with the unix command line, or soon will be.
    Type <code>ssh <i>yourusername</i>@anapnea.net</code>. This runs the ssh command, passing <i>yourusername@anapnea.net</i>
    as the only argument.

    Job done. Uh. That was it. Told you it was easy :-).

    If you want to tunnel over ssh, then you will need to open a dynamic tunnel, using the -D9090 flag.
    This flag tells ssh to open a SOCKS server on port 9090 and tunnel traffic through your ssh connection.
    Here, I type <code>ssh <i>yourusername</i>@anapnea.net -D9090</code> and then open a SSH connection as normal.
    You will need to leave this terminal open since the ssh program is keeping your tunnel open for you.

    Finally, set up your browser to use the SOCKS tunnel. The menu that you have to go through to find a dialogue similar to the
    one below will differ for each OS, but it shouldn't be too hard to find. A screenshot of how to find the one for Ubuntu
    is shown below. Once you've found it, enter localhost:9090 as the SOCKS proxy and close the dialogue.

    Finally, you may like to use a website that tells you your IP address, in order to verify that tunneling is working correctly.
    We have hosted <a href='../tunneling_check.php'>a small file</a> that will verify that you are tunneling your browsing through Anapnea.
