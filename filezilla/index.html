<div id="title">Using FileZilla</div>

<div class="step">
  <div>
    FileZilla is a moderatly popular SFTP client. Anapnea does not have a FTP server, because FTP is insecure.
    Instead you can use SFTP, which isn't strictly FTP over SSH, but it's close. FileZilla uploads and downloads
    files from Anapnea only; if you want to use the terminal, you'll need a normal SSH client.
    (<a href="../putty_connecting/">Windows</a>, <a href="../unix_ssh/">Linux or Mac</a>).
  </div>

  <div>
    Start by installing FileZilla. If you're on Mac or Windows, you probably want to
    <a href='http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client'>download it from their website</a>.
    Linux users should probably use their built-in package management system. Below, I'm using Synaptic on Ubuntu as an example.

  <div>
    The FileZilla wiki has a fairly comprensive <a href="http://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_(en)">Tutorial</a>,
    so I'm only going to cover the basics. There's tonnes of documentation at that link.

    Firstly, open FileZilla, and type <code>sftp://anapnea.net</code> into the Host box, and put your username and password in
    their respective boxes. Press QuickConnect to connect to Anapnea and verify the fingerprint.
    The advice that can be found at the bottom of the <a href="../unix_ssh/">Connecting to SSH</a> article
    with regards to fingerprints remains important and still applies here.

    The left hand side represnts files on your computer, and the right hand side represents files on Anapnea.
    You can navigate both the same way you might do in Nautilus (Linux) or Explorer (Windows).
    Files are copied from one to the other by dragging and dropping.

    The transfer should appear in the Succesful transfers tab to let you know that it completed.
    The file you coped will now appear in its new location.

    SFTP operates on the same port as SSH, that is, by default, 22. If you need to use port 443, then
    type <code>sftp://anapnea.net:443</code> into the Host box instead of just <code>sftp://anapnea.net</code>.
